## description
source code for [RVFILES](https://files.therealvanyek.ml)  
  
also, there isn't much files, and in fact, it's not a file hosting or anything like that. it's just my own polygon for design testing ;)  
i just thought it would be nice to update source code here.
  
## todo
1. create a mobile menu already you damn prick
2. allow users to create some text messages on specific page  
3. allow users to upload non-copyrighted files, which then will be accesible in files dir (and maybe some ui for it, though i suck at it)  
###### _also i suck at creating mobile menus if you haven't noticed already_
